      <h2 id="headline">This is the story of Jackie Chan's career as a legendary actor</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1962–1975: Early small appearances</strong> He began his film career by appearing in small roles at
          the age of five as a child actor. At age eight, he appeared with some of his fellow "Little Fortunes" in the
          film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (1962) with Li Li-Hua playing his mother. The following year, the young actor
          appeared in extras of The Love Eterne (1963) and had a small role in King Hu's 1966 film Come Drink with Me.
          In 1971, after an appearance as an extra in another kung fu film, A Touch of Zen, Chan was signed to Chu Mu's
          Great Earth Film Company.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1976–1980: Start-up leading roles</strong> In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan,
          a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stunt choreography work.
          Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei. Lo saw Chan's performance in the John Woo
          film Hand of Death (1976) and planned to model him after Bruce Lee with the film New Fist of Fury. His
          stage name was changed to Sing Lung (Chinese: 成龍, also transcribed as Cheng Long, literally "become the
          dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name meant "Little Dragon" in Chinese. The film
          was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style. Despite the film's failure, Lo
          Wei continued producing films with similar themes, but with little improvement at the box office.

          Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, shot while he was loaned to
          Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal. Director Yuen Woo-ping allowed Chan complete freedom
          over his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved refreshing to the Hong Kong
          audience. The same year, Chan then starred in Drunken Master, which finally propelled him to mainstream
          success.

          Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of Drunken Master, producing
          and also showed new features at the time with Jackie as the Stunt Director Half a Loaf of Kung Fu and
          Spiritual Kung Fu. He also gave Chan the opportunity to make his directorial debut in The Fearless Hyena.
          When Willie Chan left the company, he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei.
          During the shooting of Fearless Hyena Part II, Chan broke his contract and joined Golden Harvest, prompting Lo
          to blackmail Chan with triads, blaming Willie for his star's departure. The dispute was resolved with the help
          of fellow actor and director Jimmy Wang Yu, allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1980–1987: Commercial success in the action comedy genre</strong> Willie Chan became Jackie's personal
          manager and firm friend, and remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan's
          international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s. His first
          Hollywood film was The Big Brawl in 1980. Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film The Cannonball Run,
          which grossed over US$100 million worldwide. Despite being largely ignored by North American audiences in
          favour of established American actors such as Burt Reynolds, Chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the
          closing credits, inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.

          After the commercial failure of The Protector in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into
          the US market, returning his focus to Hong Kong films.[36]

          Back in Hong Kong, Chan's films began to reach a larger audience in East Asia, with early successes in the
          lucrative Japanese market including Drunken Master, The Young Master (1980) and Dragon Lord (1982). The Young
          Master went on to beat previous box office records set by Bruce Lee and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema's
          top star. With Dragon Lord, he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences, including the final
          fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to
          the lower ground.

          Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The
          three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in Project A, which introduced a dangerous stunt-driven
          style of martial arts that won it the Best Action Design Award at the third annual Hong Kong Film Awards. Over
          the following two years, the "Three Brothers" appeared in Wheels on Meals and the original Lucky Stars
          trilogy. In 1985, Chan made the first Police Story film, a crime action film in which Chan performed a number
          of dangerous stunts. It won Best Film at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards. In 1986, Chan played "Asian Hawk," an
          Indiana Jones-esque character, in the film Armour of God. The film was Chan's biggest domestic box office
          success up to that point, grossing over HK$35 million.

        <li>
          <strong>1988–1998: Acclaimed film sequels and Hollywood breakthrough</strong> In 1988, Chan starred alongside
          Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date in the film Dragons Forever. Hung co-directed with Corey
          Yuen, and the villain in the film was played by Yuen Wah, both of whom were fellow graduates of the China
          Drama Academy.

          In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with Project A
          Part II and Police Story 2, which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 Hong Kong Film
          Awards. This was followed by Armour of God II: Operation Condor, and Police Story 3: Super Cop, for which Chan
          won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 Golden Horse Film Festival. In 1994, Chan reprised his role as Wong
          Fei-hung in Drunken Master II, which was listed in Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies. Another sequel, Police
          Story 4: First Strike, brought more awards and domestic box office success for Chan, but did not fare as well
          in foreign markets.

          Up until January 1995, his films grossed over HK$500 million (US$70 million) in Hong Kong, ¥39 billion (US$489
          million) in Japan,[43] 11.5 million box office admissions in France, and 9.9 million box office admissions in
          Germany. Despite his success in Asia and Europe, he was not very successful in North America, where he had
          only two wide releases as a leading actor, The Big Brawl and The Protector, grossing US$9.51 million (US$32
          million adjusted for inflation).

          Chan rekindled his Hollywood ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood
          films to avoid being typecast in future roles. For example, Sylvester Stallone offered him the role of Simon
          Phoenix, a criminal in the futuristic film Demolition Man. Chan declined and the role was taken by Wesley
          Snipes.

          Chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the North American market in 1995 with a worldwide
          release of Rumble in the Bronx, attaining a cult following in the United States that was rare for Hong Kong
          movie stars. The success of Rumble in the Bronx led to a 1996 release of Police Story 3: Super Cop in the
          United States under the title Supercop, which grossed a total of US$16,270,600. Chan's first huge blockbuster
          success came when he co-starred with Chris Tucker in the 1998 buddy cop action comedy Rush Hour, grossing
          US$130 million in the United States alone. This film made him a Hollywood star, after which he wrote his
          autobiography in collaboration with Jeff Yang entitled I Am Jackie Chan.

          <strong>1999–2007: Fame in Hollywood and dramatisation</strong> In 1998, Chan released his final film for
          Golden Harvest, Who Am I?. After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999, he produced and starred alongside Shu Qi in
          Gorgeous, a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts
          sequences. Although Chan had left Golden Harvest in 1999, the company continued to produce and distribute for
          two of his films, Gorgeous (1999) and The Accidental Spy (2001). Chan then helped create a PlayStation game in
          2000 called Jackie Chan Stuntmaster, to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture. He continued
          his Hollywood success in 2000 when he teamed up with Owen Wilson in the Western action comedy Shanghai Noon. A
          sequel, Shanghai Knights followed in 2003 and also featured his first on-screen fight scene with Donnie Yen.
          He reunited with Chris Tucker for Rush Hour 2 (2001), which was an even bigger success than the original,
          grossing $347 million worldwide. Chan experimented with the use of special effects and wirework for the fight
          scenes in his next two Hollywood films, The Tuxedo (2002) and The Medallion (2003), which were not as
          successful critically or commercially. In 2004, he teamed up with Steve Coogan in Around the World in 80 Days,
          loosely based on Jules Verne's novel of the same name. In 2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan
          was "perhaps" the "most recognised star in the world".

          Despite the success of the Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon films, Chan became frustrated with Hollywood over the
          limited range of roles and lack of control over the filmmaking process. In response to Golden Harvest's
          withdrawal from the film industry in 2003, Chan started his own film production company, JCE Movies Limited
          (Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited) in association with Emperor Multimedia Group (EMG). His films have since
          featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to succeed at the box office; examples
          include New Police Story (2004), The Myth (2005) and the hit film Rob-B-Hood (2006).

          Chan's next release was the third instalment in the Rush Hour film series: Rush Hour 3 in August 2007. It
          grossed US$255 million. However, it was a disappointment in Hong Kong, grossing only HK$3.5 million during its
          opening weekend.

          <strong>2008–present: New experiments and change in acting style</strong> Filming of The Forbidden Kingdom,
          Chan's first on-screen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor Jet Li, was completed on 24 August 2007 and the
          movie was released in April 2008. The movie featured heavy use of effects and wires. Chan voiced Master Monkey
          in Kung Fu Panda (released in June 2008), appearing with Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and Angelina Jolie. In
          addition, he has assisted Anthony Szeto in an advisory capacity for the writer-director's film Wushu, released
          on 1 May 2008. The film stars Sammo Hung and Wang Wenjie as father and son.

          In November 2007, Chan began filming Shinjuku Incident, a dramatic role featuring no martial arts sequences
          with director Derek Yee, which sees Chan take on the role of a Chinese immigrant in Japan. The film was
          released on 2 April 2009. According to his blog, Chan discussed his wishes to direct a film after completing
          Shinjuku Incident, something he has not done for a number of years. The film was expected to be the third in
          the Armour of God series, and had a working title of Armour of God III: Chinese Zodiac. The film was released
          on 12 December 2012. Because the Screen Actors Guild did not go on strike, Chan started shooting his next
          Hollywood movie The Spy Next Door at the end of October in New Mexico. In The Spy Next Door, Chan plays an
          undercover agent whose cover is blown when he looks after the children of his girlfriend. In Little Big
          Soldier, Chan stars alongside Leehom Wang as a soldier in the Warring States period in China. He is the lone
          survivor of his army and must bring a captured enemy soldier Leehom Wang to the capital of his province.

          In 2010, he starred with Jaden Smith in The Karate Kid, a remake of the 1984 original. This was Chan's first
          dramatic American film. He plays Mr. Han, a kung fu master and maintenance man who teaches Jaden Smith's
          character kung fu so he can defend himself from school bullies. His role in The Karate Kid won him the
          Favorite Buttkicker award at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2011. In Chan's next movie, Shaolin, he
          plays a supporting role as a cook of a temple instead of one of the major characters.

          His 100th movie, 1911, was released on 26 September 2011. Chan was the co-director, executive producer, and
          lead star of the movie. While Chan has directed over ten films over his career, this was his first directorial
          work since Who Am I? in 1998. 1911 premiered in North America on 14 October.

          While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan announced that he was retiring from action films citing that he
          was getting too old for the genre. He later clarified that he would not be completely retiring from action
          films, but would be performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.

          In 2013, Chan starred in Police Story 2013, a reboot of the Police Story franchise directed by Ding Sheng, and
          it was released in China at the end of 2013. Chan's next film Dragon Blade was released in early 2015 and
          co-starred Hollywood actors John Cusack and Adrien Brody. In 2015, Chan was awarded the title of "Datuk" by
          Malaysia as he helped Malaysia to boost its tourism, especially in Kuala Lumpur where he previously shot his
          films. In early 2017, Chan's new film titled Kung Fu Yoga, a Chinese-Indian project, which also starred Disha
          Patani, Sonu Sood and Amyra Dastur, was released. The film reunited Chan with director Stanley Tong, who
          directed a number of Chan's films in the 1990s. Upon release, the film was a huge success at the box office,
          and became the 5th highest-grossing film in China, one month after its release. In 2016, he teamed up with
          Johnny Knoxville and starred in his own production Skiptrace.

          Chan starred in the 2016 action-comedy Railroad Tigers and the 2017 action-thriller The Foreigner, an
          Anglo-Chinese production. He also stars in the science fiction film Bleeding Steel. In 2021, he will appear in
          Project X-Traction alongside John Cena.

          His films had collectively grossed HK$1.14 billion (US$145 million) at the Hong Kong box office up until 2010,
          over US$72 million in South Korea between 1991 and 2010, and ¥48.4 billion (US$607 million) in Japan up until
          2012.[43] As of 2018, his films have grossed US$1.84 billion (more than US$2.44 billion adjusted for
          inflation) in the United States and Canada,[56] CN¥8.6 billion (US$1.24 billion) in China, 20 million box
          office admissions in France, and over 27.3 million admissions in Germany, Spain and Italy. As of 2018, his
          films have grossed more than US$5 billion at the worldwide box office.
